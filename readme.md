# GDXCapture
A godot extension that allows capture of X11 windows (or screens.. soon?) and converting them to textures.
  
## DISCLAIMER
This project is very WIP. It's my first time working with X11 and Xlib so it probably is riddled with bugs and bad practices.
  
ALSO, this, for now, is just a personal project for something I need, I will most probably not implement changes requested by others. But I will accept PRs :)
  
# BUILD
Follow the godot extension build tutorial.
